    bio: `Hi! My name is Mahin, and I love trying new thingsâ€”whether itâ€™s in technology or real life. Iâ€™m passionate about coding, math, and solving problems. Basically, if itâ€™s nerdy, Iâ€™m into it. I also love games, and my ultimate goal is to be a game developer.
    
**Contribution:** I worked on the main coding for all the elements and features of this website, focusing mainly on implementing React Flow and visualizing the concepts.

    bio: `Hey, my name is Parsa and Iâ€™m super passionate about all things theoretical computer science. Stuff like logic, algorithms, complexity theory, AI, game theory, fairness theory, graphs and a bunch of other nerdy stuff that I love learning.
    
**Contribution:** I worked on the theoretical explanations behind concepts and the math/algorithms required to implement them.

Special thanks to Steph McIntyre, Noah Fleming, Antonina Kolokolova, Todd Wareham, and Rylo Ashmore for teaching me much of what I know about theoretical CS.

For any questions/comments/ideas, please reach out to me at parsa@intuitivecs.ca ðŸ™‚`,

    bio: `Hello! Iâ€™m Shajan, the wordsmith behind our projectâ€™s content. I focus on creating clear, engaging, and informative content that effectively communicates our ideas and concepts. My goal is to ensure that our website is not only technically sound but also rich in valuable information for our users.
    
**Contribution:** I developed and managed the websiteâ€™s content, ensuring that theoretical concepts explained by Parsa are clearly communicated. I also collaborated with Mahin to integrate content seamlessly with the implemented features.
